# CPP Notepad program 

This tiny program provides a simple command-line interface where one can choose to write to a file, read from a file, or exit the program. When writing to a file, you can input text line by line, and to save and exit, you can use the appropriate keyboard shortcut (Ctrl + Z for Windows or Ctrl + D for Unix-like systems).
